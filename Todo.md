#General TODO#:

* Do more classifications
* Try to have both caravan and caravan new code available and usable at the same time
* Test and fix if not working filters
* Fix that scrollbar is not always working (related to drilldown click I'm sure)
* Enable multi-select of items

Done:
* Fix searching at different levels
* Fix sorting at different levels (might revisit, it's not 100% satisfactory, probably disable lower level sorts when we are in a higher hierarchy?)
